PERSONAL CRAZINESS INDEX 
Part One - Preparation 
The Personal Craziness Index (PCI) is based on two assumptions: 
1) Craziness first manifests itself in routine, simple behaviors that support lifestyle balance. 
2)	Behavioral signs will occur in patterns involving different parts of our lives. Thus, we can be caught up in issues of cosmic importance and not notice that our checking account is overdrawn. If our checking account is overdrawn, we are probably out of socks as well, because we have not done our laundry. If this pattern is pervasive, there is risk that our lives will become emotionally bankrupt as well---cosmic issues notwithstanding. 
Addicts and co-addicts are particularly vulnerable to the "insanity" of loss of reality from having neglected the basics. "Keep it simple" and "a day at a time" are not shopworn clichés but guidelines borne out by the experience of many recovering people. The PCI helps you to remember what you need to do each day. It helps you establish good recovery habits. Without a process for such reminders, "cunning and baffling," self-destructive behavior patterns will return. You'll also find the PCI helpful during periods of stress and vulnerability. 
The process of creating your own PCI is designed to be as value-free as possible. Each person uses his or her own criteria to develop the index. In other words, you are asked to generate behavioral signs (or "critical incidents") which, through your own experience, you have learned to identity as danger signs or warnings that you are "losing it," "getting out of hand," or "burnt-out." Thus, you will judge yourself by your own standards. 
You may change the items in the index as you progress in your recovery. The following are ten areas of personal behavior suggested as sources of danger signs. Add some of your own if you wish. 
1.	Physical Health - The ultimate insanity is to not take care of our bodies. Without our bodies, we have nothing, yet we seem to have little time for physical conditioning. Examples are being overweight, abusing cigarettes or caffeine, not getting regular exercise, eating junk food, getting insufficient sleep, and having a lingering sickness. When do you know that you are not taking care of your body (at least three examples)? 

Eat at least two balanced meals.
In bed 12am – 8am.
Ride bicycle twice per week.
Brush teeth.









 
2.	Transportation - How people get from place to place is often a statement about their lifestyles. Take, for example, a car owner who seldom comes to a full stop, routinely exceeds the speed limit, runs out of gas, does not check the oil, puts off needed repairs, has not cleaned the back seat out in three months, and averages three speeding tickets and ten parking tickets a year. Or the bus rider who always misses the bus, never has change, forgets his or her briefcase on the bus, and so forth. What transportation behaviors indicate that your life is getting out of control (at least three examples)? 

Only leave once.
Be on time.
Keep car clean.



3.	Environment - To not have time to maintain your personal space chores is a comment on the order of your life. Consider the home in which plants go unwatered, fish unfed, grocery supply depleted, laundry not done or put away, cleaning neglected, dishes unwashed, etc. What are ways in which you neglect your home or living space (at least three examples)? 

Plan daily shopping.
Clean kitchen.
Put away clothes.



4.	Work - Chaos at work is risky for recovery. Signs of chaotic behavior are phone calls not returned within twenty-four hours, chronic lateness for appointments, being behind in promised work, an unmanageable in-basket, and "too many irons in the fire". When your life is unmanageable at work, what are your behaviors (at least three examples)? 

Return calls.
Meet deadlines.
Under-promise.



5.	Interests - What are some positive interests besides work which give you perspective on the world? Music, reading, photography, fishing, and gardening are examples. What are you neglecting when you are overextended (at least three examples)? 

Bicycling.
Reading.
Learning.

	 
6.	Social Life - Think of friends in your social network who constitute significant support for you and are not family or significant others. When you become isolated alienated or disconnected from them, what behaviors are typical of you (at least three examples)? 

Make support calls.
Contact friends.
Plan activities with friends.


7.	Family/Significant Others - When you are disconnected from those closest to you, what is your behavior like (at least three examples)? Examples are silent, overtly hostile, and passive-aggressive. 

Be tolerant.
Be patient.
Show compassion.

8.	Finances - We handle our financial resources much as we do our emotional ones. Thus, when your checking account is unbalanced or worse, overdrawn, or bills are overdue, or there is no cash in your pocket, or you are spending more than you earn, your financial overextension may parallel your emotional bankruptcy. List the signs that show when you are financially overextended (at least three examples)? 

Budget expenses.
Pay bills on time.
Meet obligations.

9.	Spiritual Life and Personal Reflection - Spirituality can be diverse and can include such practices as meditation, yoga, and prayer. Personal reflection includes keeping a personal journal, working the Twelve Step program with daily readings, and getting therapy. What are sources of routine personal reflection that you neglect when you are overextended? (at least three examples)

Pray.
Meditation/reflection.
Practice 12-Steps.

10.	Other Addictions or Symptom Behaviors - Compulsive behaviors that have negative consequences are symptomatic of your general well-being or the state of your overall recovery. When you watch inordinate amounts of TV, overeat, bite your nails --- any habit you feel bad about afterward --- these can be signs of "bum out" or possible relapse. Symptom behaviors are behaviors that are evidence of overextension, such as forgetfulness, slips of the tongue, or jealousy. What negative addiction or symptom behaviors are present when you are "on the edge" (at least three examples)? 

Acceptance.
Stay clean and sober.
Asceticism.

Part Two - Recording Your PCI 
The PCI is effective only when a careful record is maintained. Recording your daily progress in conjunction with regular journal keeping will help you to keep focused on priorities which keep life manageable; work on program efforts a day at a time; expand your knowledge of personal patterns; provide a warning in periods of vulnerability to self-destructive cycles or addictive relapse. 
From the thirty or more signs of personal craziness you recorded, choose the seven that are most critical for you. At the end of each day, review the list of seven key signs and count the ones you did that day, giving each behavior one point Record your total for that day in the space provided on the chart. If you fail to record the number of points for each day, that day receives an automatic score of 7. (If you cannot even do your score, you are obviously out of balance.) At the end of each week, total your seven daily scores and make an X on graph. Pause and reflect on where you are in your recovery. Chart your progress over a twelve-week period. 
My seven key signs of personal craziness: 
1. In bed 12am – 8am.
2. Eat two balanced meals.
3. Bicycle.
4. Plan daily shopping.
5. Make support calls.
6. Be patient.
7. Practice 12-Steps.

PCI MEDITATION 
Use the PCI as a gentle nudge to move you in the direction you want to go. As addicts and co-addicts we can get compulsive and obsessive about almost anything - self-improvement included. One co-addict who uses The Gentle Path Through the Twelve Steps described her first attempt at using the PCI. She was determined to do it right and put her life in order -- once and for all. Finances had always been her greatest area of shame, so she spent two days designing a complete budget. The computerized spreadsheet listed all her income and all the bills that would be paid on each payday for the next two years. This was a good attempt on her part to put her finances in order. Unfortunately, the two days she spent doing the budget were April 14 and 15. In spending all the time on her spreadsheets, she forgot to send in her taxes. To stay on the gentle path and yet work toward your goals, here is some advice: 
* Choose to do the inventory for a specific amount of time, such as twelve weeks, or any time period that has a specific beginning and ending. After that time, review the process and decide to extend the time or do spot-check inventories each month, each quarter, or around the holidays or significant anniversary dates. The thing we know about the inventory is that it modifies behavior. If you are going to have to report on yourself every night, you will find yourself behaving in a manner that will make it comfortable for you to report on yourself.. 
* Be patient with yourself. To change after years of compulsive behavior is a large task. Allow yourself the luxury of making mistakes. Even taking small steps toward balance provides a sense of satisfaction. 
* Accept yourself. Remember your sense of humor. Be able to laugh at some of the situations that you find yourself in, but then go on and do what you can. Accept the imperfect. 
* Working on your boundaries is a process -- not a destination. Set those PCI parameters as boundaries of healthy behavior -- a goal to work toward. Later, when those goals have been achieved, you will want to redo the PCI and set new parameters. 
* Talk to your recovering friends about your progress and your failures. They will be your mirrors to help you see when your compulsivity is getting out of control. 
* Understand that things will change. There is as much challenge in trying to achieve balance as there was when we were constantly facing the chaos of living on the edge. The PCI is designed to give you a stable base so that when the unexpected comes up you won't be thrown off your balance.
